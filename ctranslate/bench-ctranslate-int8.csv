 sierp 2019
Javascript and Python are two of the most popular programming languages in the world. They are both used for web development, but they have some key differences.
Javascript is a client-side scripting language, which means it is executed in the browser. This makes it ideal for creating interactive web applications. Python, on the other hand, is a server-side scripting language, which means it is executed on the server. This makes it ideal for creating web applications that require a lot of processing power.
Another key difference between Javascript and Python is their syntax. Javascript uses a syntax that is similar to English, while Python uses a syntax that is more similar to mathematics. This can make it easier for some people to learn Javascript, while others may find Python easier to learn.
Finally, Javascript and Python have different ecosystems. Javascript has a large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that can be used to create web applications",CTranslate2 int8 quantization
