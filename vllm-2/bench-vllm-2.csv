210,3.540655323304236,Write a Rust function that performs binary exponentiation.,"Write a Rust function that performs binary exponentiation. The cargo_rustc arguments to tell your program what the outputs should be (and also help you figure out what the error is if you get some odd errors)Rust is widely supported on the ITU-T’s Best Common Practice (BCP) feature list because its performance is very data-driven. If you’re trying to achieve a peak transfer rate of better than 80% of theoretical maximum, an out-of-band BIAS is not appropriate. Examples with Rust Unlike many other languages, Rust has very few options for using arrays, and builtin structures. It is possible to indirectly use arrays (or structs) by iterating over them, but this is not often recommended (if you have a use for them, a struct may be more appropriate).{ dionysus (Pandemonic), Scrag-the-slaver, RonaldProsquis, roleyplaya ",vllm-fastapi-server

Tutor: Kipton, please answer this Ask question.
The pattern is a_1 = 3, a_2 = 5 and ax = a(x-1) + ax-1 for x>2.
