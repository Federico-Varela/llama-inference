214,1.0860637499990844,Write a Rust function that performs binary exponentiation.,"<s> Write a Rust function that performs binary exponentiation. 

The function should take two arguments: a `u64` and a `u64` and return a `u64`.

The function should perform the following steps:

1. If the first argument is less than the second argument, return the first argument.
2. If the first argument is greater than the second argument, return the second argument.
3. If the first argument is equal to the second argument, return the first argument.

## Example

```
fn binary_exponentiation(first: u64, second: u64) -> u64 {
    if first < second {
        first
    } else if first > second {
        second
    } else {
        first
    }
}
```

## Tests
