Given two integers `a` and `b`, return the result of `a` raised to the power of `b`, that is, `a ^ b`.

You can assume that `a` and `b` are non-negative integers.
```
fn exponentiate(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 { ... }
```
Hint: You can use the bitwise `<<` operator to perform the exponentiation.

Note that this function should not panic if `a` or `b` is 0.

 Furthermore, this function should not use the `pow` function or any other library function. You must implement this function using only basic Rust operations.

Please provide a detailed explanation of your solution.

Here's an example of what you can do with this function:
```
let result = exponentiate(2, 3);  // result"
['What are the differences between Javascript and Python?'],vLLM/Modal A100,200,4.8011041169957025,"

Javascript and Python are two of the most popular programming languages in use today. While both languages share some similarities, such as the ability to manipulate data and perform operations on it, they also have some key differences that set them apart. Here are some of the main differences between the two languages:

1. Syntax: The syntax of the two languages is quite different. Javascript is a curly-brace language, which means that code is surrounded by curly braces to define a block of code. Python, on the other hand, uses indentation to define code blocks.

2. Dynamic Typing: Javascript is a dynamically-typed language, which means that the data type of a variable is determined at runtime, rather than at compile time. Python is also dynamically-typed.

3. Object-Oriented Programming: Both languages support object-oriented programming (OOP), but they differ in their approach to OOP. Javascript uses"

This is a fun assignment!

The eyebrows of Bridget Conroy scrunched up in a puzzle as she read the email from her distant cousin, Moira.

""The outback in 2083?"" Bridget said aloud, ""You're not still talking about those robots, are you?""

Moira had always had an odd fascination with the Australian outback, and more recently, with the robots that had begun to inhabit the vast, arid landscape. Bridget had never understood why her cousin would choose to visit such a remote and inhospitable place, especially now that the robots had taken over most of the world's vital functions and there was no longer any need to travel.

But despite her initial skepticism, Bridget couldn't deny the allure of the outback. She had always been drawn to the abstract, the surreal,"

Title: The Time-Traveling Historian's Quest

Professor Emma Taylor had always been fascinated by the past. As a historian, she had spent her career studying the events that shaped human civilization, from the dawn of agriculture to the present day. But despite her extensive knowledge, she felt like something was missing. She had never truly experienced the past for herself, content to simply read about it in books or watch it on screens.

One day, while working in her office at the university, Emma stumbled upon an old, mysterious-looking watch in a dusty forgotten drawer. As soon as she put it on her wrist, she felt a strange sensation wash over her. Suddenly, she was transported to ancient Egypt, surrounded by pyramids and pharaohs.

Over the next few weeks, Emma found herself time-traveling to different eras of"

"['If a train travels 120 kilometers in 2 hours, what is its average speed?']",vLLM/Modal A100,70,1.6725561229977757,"
To find the average speed, we need to divide the distance traveled by the time taken:

Average speed = Distance / Time
= 120 km / 2 hours
= 60 km/h

So, the train's average speed is 60 kilometers per hour."

I know this is an arithmetic sequence and I know the common difference is a_(n-1) + a_(n-2), but I'm not sure how to apply that to this problem. Could someone please help me? Thank you!

Did you try substituting a_n = a_(n-1) + a_(n-2) into the definition of a_n?

: Yes, I did try that. I got a_6 = 3 + 5 + 3 + 5, but I don't know how to simplify that.

You're on the right track! Try adding the first two terms:

a_6 = 3 + 5

Do you see what you get?

: Yes, I see it now. I get 8.

Correct! So, a_6 = 8."
