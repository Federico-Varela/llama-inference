Write a Rust function that performs binary exponentiation.,vLLM,389,8.590083795999817,"
Write a Rust function that performs binary exponentiation. You can use the [Binomial Coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient) formula to precompute values for small inputs, so you may write an implementation that uses these precomputed values if you would like.
For example, if you are writing a program to calculate the number of ways to arrange 4 objects, you would first determine the binomial coefficients for all possible arrangements (1 way, 2 ways, 3 ways, and 4 ways). With these values determined, your program can compute any value for x by only multiplying together the appropriate values in the array.
However, since there is no standard library for Rust, you will need to supply your own set of binomial coefficients for all values of n up to 10.
You will not be able to reuse any functions from the standard library.
Binary (base-2) notation should be used in all output. For example, 8192 should be represented as 1000000000, not 512.
a: the number of digits in your result (must be between 2 and 10).
b: the base of your representation (must be 2).
c: the digit you want at the nth position of your answer (must be between 0 and 9).
n: the number of positions you want to shift (must be between 0 and b-1).
Return a string containing the number of ways to arrange the input objects with the given arrangement (c). If there are no arrangements possible, return “0”.
Running your code through the [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/) is a great way to debug your program.</s>"
What are the differences between Javascript and Python?,vLLM,695,15.498001870997541,"
As far as I know, Javascript and Python are two widely used programming languages for web development. Not only this, but both of them have got their own importance and dominance in the world of website development. If we look at their popularity then there is no doubt that they are equally famous among developers. But the debate on which one is better between these two always exists. And one of the major reasons behind this is also the fact that both languages are quite different from each other. What makes them different? In this article, we will discuss a list of differences between JavaScript and Python that developers should know.
The first difference between JavaScript and Python is that when we talk about scripting language then Python is considered to be the most popular choice whereas JavaScript is not so much popular with this title. The reason behind the dominance of Python over JavaScript is that it is more commonly used for general-purpose programming rather than Scripting, i.e. its usage is wider than scripts.
JavaScript was initially developed by Netscape back in 1995 while Python was developed by Guido van Rossum.
Python supports OOPs concept which includes classes, objects, methods, etc. whereas Javascript doesn’t support this feature.
There are some libraries available for Python like Django, Flask, Pyramid, etc. whereas javascript has jQuery which is one of the most popular libraries.
Javascript is easy to learn, there are a lot of online resources available for learning it. Whereas python is quite difficult to learn due to its syntax which might confuse beginners.
Another big difference between these two is that JavaScript is an object-based programming language whereas Python is a class-based programming language. It means that Javascript uses variables to store data and function to manipulate that data whereas Python uses classes and objects to create new classes and objects.
One of the biggest advantages of Python is that it provides an easier and faster way to test your code than JavaScript does. But on the other hand, the disadvantage of Python is that it requires more memory space than JavaScript does.
So, these were some of the major differences between JavaScript and Python. While JavaScript is easy to learn and it has jQuery for adding dynamic design elements into websites, Python is slower but offers many benefits like an excellent documentation system, wide range of modules and libraries, and so on.
When it comes to comparing Python vs Javascript, then there are many other differences that you should know about these two languages. Some of them are given below:
Python is an open-source programming language whereas JavaScript is proprietary.
Due to being open-source, Python supports multiple platforms such as Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, and even IoT devices. On the other hand, JavaScript can run on a single platform i.e. Microsoft Windows.
Python supports static typing which means that the type of a variable must be known before the program executes whereas JavaScript supports dynamic typing which means that the type of a variable can change during execution.
Conclusion – Although both Python and JavaScript are good choices for front-end web development, JavaScript has some limitations when compared with Python. However, if you want to build a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript then JavaScript is definitely better than Python because of its flexibility in terms of cross-platform compatibility. So, we hope you find this information useful.</s>"

"If a train travels 120 kilometers in 2 hours, what is its average speed?",vLLM,800,17.93543462499656,"
How do you find the average speed of a train?

What is the formula for the average speed problem?
How do you solve a speed problem?
How do you calculate the average speed of a moving object?
What is average speed in math?
What is the formula of speed?
How do you find the speed of something?
For example, if you want to know the average speed of a race car that travels 120 miles in 15 hours, simply plug those values into the equation: Average Speed = (Distance / Time) ÷ 2. In this case, we get: Average Speed = (120 mi/15 h) ÷ 2. The answer is 8 mph.
To find the average speed, divide the total distance traveled by the elapsed time. That number is your average speed. If you’re ever looking at textbook problems or getting started with science or physics, remember to use the correct unit of measurement.
Average Speed Formula: Distance ÷ Time
The average speed of a car is calculated as follows: Average Speed = (total distance traveled)/(total time taken). In other words, it means that the average speed of a car is the distance traveled by the car divided by the total time taken to cover that distance.
Average Speed Formula – Example #3
Solution: Let’s say you start out on a 4 hour bike ride and end up riding 100km (62mi). To convert from km to miles, multiply by . 62 (or divide by 1.61). Your end distance is 62 mi. Therefore, your average speed is 62 mi/h. Or, 100km/4h.
An object’s speed is the distance it travels in a certain amount of time. You can figure out an object’s average speed by dividing its distance by the amount of time it took to travel that distance. For instance, if a runner moves 100 meters in 30 seconds, their average speed is 10 meters per second.
How to Calculate the Average Speed of a Moving Object
Divide the measured distance traveled by the measured time elapsed.
Multiply that number by 2, or 1/2, and you will have the answer to “How fast was the object going?”
If you are asked about the speed of a car traveling from point A to point B, that would be easy to determine. Just add up the distance and divide it by the time. But what about a moving object such as a baseball player moving between bases? How do you calculate the average speed of a moving object?
Speed measures how quickly a vehicle is moving, while velocity is the combination of both speed and direction. If a vehicle is traveling at 90 kilometers (km) per hour with no change in direction, then it is said to be travelling at a velocity of 90 km/hr. When a vehicle is traveling at 110 kilometers per hour with a constant direction, then it has a velocity of 110 km/hr.
The formula for speed is distance over time which equals the rate at which an object moves. Speed is also known as rate of motion, velocity or linear momentum. We usually measure speed in meters per second. It can be calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time it takes to travel that distance.
To find the speed of something, use the following formula: Speed = Total Distance Traveled / Total Time Taken. Suppose you were driving from San Francisco to Los Angeles on Interstate 5 and wanted to"
"Think through this step by step. If the sequence a_n is defined by a_1 = 3, a_2 = 5, and a_n = a_(n-1) + a_(n-2) for n > 2, find a_6.",vLLM,242,5.344469404997653,"
I know that a_6=3
a_6=5+a_(n-2)
a_6=5+3
a_6=8
Edit: I've been trying to think this out and I just can't come up with the right answer. How do you come up with a_6=8 ?
Darq, Aug 17, 2004
Try induction.
Step 1 - prove that a_1 = 3 is true.
Step 2 - assume a_n is defined by a_i for i <= n-1
Step 3 - prove that a_n = a_(n-1) + a_(n-2) is true.
Step 4 - apply Step 3 to a_n+1
Most people find it easier to write down the base case first and then assume the inductive hypothesis.
ah, ok thanks
