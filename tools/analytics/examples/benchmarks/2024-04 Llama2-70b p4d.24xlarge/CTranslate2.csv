200,9.806170814000325,Write a Rust function that performs binary exponentiation.,"
Binary exponentiation is a method of computing large powers of a number, which works by repeatedly squaring the number. For example, to compute 210, we can do the following:
210 = 22 * 22 * 22 * 22 * 22
= 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 * 2
= 16 * 16 * 4 * 2
= 256 * 64 * 2
= 16384 * 2
= 32768 * 1
The binary exponentiation algorithm works by repeatedly squaring the number and multiplying it by itself. The algorithm is as follows:
function binary_exponentiation(base, exponent):
if exponent == 0:
return base * binary_exponentiation(base, exponent - 1)
