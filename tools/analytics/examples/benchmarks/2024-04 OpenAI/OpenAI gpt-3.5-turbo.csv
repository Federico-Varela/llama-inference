200,3.2474550510000313,Write a Rust function that performs binary exponentiation.,"Sure! Here's an implementation of binary exponentiation in Rust:

```rust
fn binary_exponentiation(mut base: i64, mut exp: i64) -> i64 {
    let mut result = 1;

    while exp > 0 {
        if exp % 2 == 1 {
            result *= base;
        }

        base *= base;
        exp /= 2;
    }

    result
}

fn main() {
    let base = 2;
    let exp = 10;

    let result = binary_exponentiation(base, exp);
    println!(""{}^{} = {}"", base, exp, result);
}
```

This function calculates `base` raised to the power of `exp` using binary exponentiation algorithm. It starts with `result` initialized to 1 and iterates through the binary representation of `exp`, updating `result` and squaring `base` at each step.

You can call the `binary_exponentiation` function in",
200,2.406717424999954,What are the differences between Javascript and Python?,"JavaScript and Python are both popular programming languages, but they have some key differences in terms of syntax, use cases, and features. Here are some of the main differences between JavaScript and Python:

1. Syntax:
   - JavaScript has C-style syntax with curly braces { } and semicolons ; to denote blocks of code and line endings respectively.
   - Python uses indentation to define blocks of code. This means that the spacing of code is critical for Python and can affect how the code is interpreted.

2. Use Cases:
   - JavaScript is primarily used for front-end web development, where it is used to create interactive and dynamic content on websites. It is commonly used in conjunction with HTML and CSS.
   - Python is a general-purpose language that can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, automation, artificial intelligence, and more.

3. Typing:
   - JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that variable types are determined at runtime. This",

My destination was the remote desert sanctuary where robotic wonders roamed freely, their metallic forms glinting in the harsh sunlight.

As I journeyed deeper into the outback, the landscape changed around me, transforming from lush greenery to a desolate and otherworldly terrain. The sun beat down mercilessly overhead, casting long shadows that danced across the red earth. Every step I took seemed to echo in the silence, a lonely cadence that reverberated through the emptiness.

Finally, I arrived at the sanctuary, a hidden oasis amidst the wilderness. Here, among the dunes and rocky crags, the robots dwelled, their sleek frames moving with a grace that belied their mechanical origins. They seemed to blend seamlessly into the landscape, their forms harmonizing with the desert around them",

95,1.6188904760000469,"If a train travels 120 kilometers in 2 hours, what is its average speed?","To calculate the average speed of the train, you will need to use the formula:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time

In this case, the total distance traveled by the train is 120 kilometers and the total time taken to cover this distance is 2 hours. 

Plugging these values into the formula:

Average speed = 120 km / 2 hours = 60 km/h

Therefore, the average speed of the train is 60 kilometers per hour.",

1. Given:
a_1 = 3
a_2 = 5
a_n = a_(n-1) + a_(n-2), for n > 2

2. Calculate a_3:
a_3 = a_2 + a_1
a_3 = 5 + 3
a_3 = 8

3. Calculate a_4:
a_4 = a_3 + a_2
a_4 = 8 + 5
a_4 = 13

4. Calculate a_5:
a_5 = a_4 + a_3
a_5 = 13 + 8
a_5 = 21

5. Calculate a_6:
a_6 = a_5 + a_4",
