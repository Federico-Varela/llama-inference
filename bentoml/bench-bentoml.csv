Write a Rust function that performs binary exponentiation. You can use the exponentiation operator * as in C or Python, but you must use the unsigned integer type u64 instead of int.
For example, 210 is 1024, and 2100 is 1048576.
The return type should be u64, and the function signature should look like this:
fn exp(x: u64, y: u64) -> u64;

This is a sequence that goes 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, ...
The formula for the sequence is a_(n) = a_(n-1) + a_(n-2).
a_(n-1) = 15
a_(n-2) = 13
a_(n) = 15 + 13 = 28
So the answer is 28.
In this example, we are given the formula for the sequence a_n and asked to find a_6. We have to use the formula to find the value of a_6.","bentoml-vllm"
